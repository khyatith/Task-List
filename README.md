# Task-List

This is a task list app. You can add, remove or Edit tasks.

tech stack : 1. create-react-app
			2. state management: Redux
			3. other libraries used: I have used jest for testing and lodash for handling immutability of state in redux

Note: Due to the time constraints, I have added only a few tests. I have tried to show how to test components, actions and reducers.


To run it:

1. clone repo
2. cd tasklistapp
3. npm install
4. npm start
